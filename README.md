A Model for Body Rigging and Proprioception for VR

This permits the VR user's virtual body to be mapped to the users body with as much censor data as is available, starting with the position of the HMD and the controllers.  

Ultimately it would also be nice to model the operator's chair.

Might want to keep the basic model sufficiently generic that we can use it for character modeling as well.
